# Procedural Generation — Design Brief

Architecture decisions for the SeedRock noise + erosion + form pipeline. This is a
**hybrid** document: the first half is a research synthesis (with citations and
confidence flags), the second half maps those decisions back to the code you'll
read in `src/`.

Confidence is flagged where sources are thin or the design is a pragmatic
compromise rather than a faithful model — same convention as SeedThree's
`generation-design.md`. **Every citation has a verifiable URL/DOI; see
[References](#references) at the end.** All URLs verified July 2026.

## TL;DR

- **Primary method: noise-based mesh displacement + vertex-domain erosion
  simulation**, dispatched over four geometry "form primitives" (boulder /
  columnar / slate / crystal).
- This is the *opposite* design choice from [SeedThree](https://github.com/SkyeShark/SeedThree),
  which uses the [Weber & Penn 1995](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/218380.218427)
  parametric model. Trees have a **botanical blueprint** (a recursive branching
  grammar with a century of dendrology behind it); rocks do not. Rocks have a
  **geological history** (stress, fracture, weathering). So SeedThree builds a
  skeleton; SeedRock sculpts a surface.
- Secondary inputs come from real geomorphology: hillslope diffusion
  ([Culling 1960](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JZ065i004p01561)),
  particle hydraulic erosion ([Musgrave 1989](http://www.kenmusgrave.com/dissertation.pdf);
  [Mei et al. 2007](https://inria.hal.science/inria-00402079/PDF/FastErosion_PG07.pdf)),
  and — as a *target, not yet a model* — Domokos–Gibbons pebble abrasion
  ([Domokos & Gibbons 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3922984/))
  for the `river_cobble` species.

## PART A — Research synthesis

### 1. Why not Weber–Penn / L-systems?

[Weber & Penn 1995](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/218380.218427) [1] models trees
as a **hierarchical branching skeleton** with per-level parameters (curve, taper,
down-angle, phyllotactic child placement, the Da Vinci pipe-model radius law).
That works because a tree *is* a branching skeleton — the paper encodes a real
botanical blueprint.

A rock has no such skeleton. Its visible form is the *result* of:
1. An initial mass (magma → crystallization, sediment → lithification, etc.),
2. Fracture under stress (joints, foliation, crystal habits),
3. Surface weathering (thermal cycling, water, biological action).

So the SeedRock pipeline mirrors that order: **base geometry (the mass) → form
primitives (the fracture structure) → erosion simulation (the weathering).**
There is no analogue of `generateSkeleton()`; the "structure" is the geometry
itself, sculpted by noise and erosion. *(This is also why the Phase 5 roadmap
explores an explicit structure-skeleton layer for the structural forms — see
[Future: structure skeleton](#future-structure-skeleton).)*

### 2. Noise as the primary shape driver

The boulder form (the dominant form, used by 10 of 15 species) gets its silhouette
from **3D gradient noise sampled radially** along each vertex's direction from the
shape origin. The noise function is a compact implementation of **Perlin gradient
noise** ([Perlin 1985](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/325165.325247) [2];
[Perlin 2002](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/566570.566636) [3] for the improved
polynomial fade `6t⁵−15t⁴+10t³`), fractal-summed as **fBm** (fractional Brownian
motion — [Mandelbrot 1982](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4757-4017-2) [4]).

Two samplers are exposed:
- `fbm()` — smooth fractal sum, the default for most rocks.
- `ridged()` — `(1−|n|)²` per octave, producing sharp ridges; used for volcanic /
  angular species. This is the ridged-multifractal variant documented in
  *Texturing & Modeling: A Procedural Approach* (Ebert et al.), the same family
  SeedThree cites for terrain.

Why hand-rolled rather than a library? Three reasons: (a) SeedRock needs the noise
**seeded per (species, seed)** — the permutation table is filled by a Fisher–Yates
shuffle driven by the same `Rng` (`xmur3` → `splitmix32`) that threads through the
whole generator, so the same `(species, seed)` is byte-reproducible; (b) it's ~80
lines; (c) we need both `fbm` and `ridged` in the same seeded table. *(Pragmatic
choice, not a claim the hand-rolled noise is better than `simplex-noise` etc.)*

### 3. Erosion simulation — the geomorphology layer

After the base geometry is displaced, three erosion passes operate **directly on
mesh vertices** via adjacency lists (vertices are first welded with
`mergeVertices`). Each maps to a real geomorphological process:

#### 3.1 Thermal erosion → hillslope diffusion

Steep vertices shed material to lower neighbors, conserving mass. This is the
mesh-domain analogue of **hillslope soil creep modeled as linear diffusion**
([Culling 1960](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JZ065i004p01561) [5]),
where sediment flux is proportional to local slope — the "talus angle" threshold
in the code is the discrete rest-angle of granular material. The classic
computer-graphics formulation for terrain comes from
[Musgrave, Kolb & Mace 1989](http://www.kenmusgrave.com/dissertation.pdf) [6].

> **Honest limitation (medium confidence).** The current `thermalErode()` (in
> [`src/generator/erosion.js`](../src/generator/erosion.js)) transports material
> only along the world-Y axis (`deltas[ix + 1]`), which is the *height-field*
> form of the model. On a fully 3D rock this means material only falls straight
> down, not along the local steepest-descent direction. This is fine for boulders
> (near-convex, gravity-aligned) but underplays talus aprons on overhangs. The
> Phase 5 refactor would generalize this to true 3D gradient transport.

#### 3.2 Hydraulic erosion → droplet particle simulation

Droplets are dropped onto the mesh, walk downhill to the lowest neighbor, carry
sediment with inertia, evaporate (`water *= 0.96`), erode based on height-drop ×
water capacity, and deposit in pits. This is the **particle-based "virtual
droplet" hydraulic erosion** family introduced to CG by
[Musgrave 1989](http://www.kenmusgrave.com/dissertation.pdf) [6] and widely
disseminated in its fast-GPU form by
[Mei, Decaudin & Hu 2007](https://inria.hal.science/inria-00402079/PDF/FastErosion_PG07.pdf)
[7]. The SeedRock implementation runs on the CPU over vertex adjacency rather
than on a 2D height-field grid (the standard Mei et al. setup), because a rock is
a closed 3D surface, not a terrain.

#### 3.3 Edge wear → curvature-driven smoothing

High-curvature vertices (convex corners, edges) are pushed slightly inward along
the radial normal. Curvature is measured as the average of `1 − n·n_neighbor` — a
discrete mean-curvature proxy. This rounds chips and sharpens weathered edges; it
is a generic mesh-processing operation rather than a named geomorphic process,
but it captures the **mechanical weathering** that rounds exposed corners faster
than flat faces.

### 4. Form primitives — geology, not just geometry

The four form factories correspond to four real geological modes of occurrence.
Currently boulder is the only one that's truly noise-driven; the other three are
**structural geometry assembly**. *(This asymmetry is the explicit motivation for
the Phase 5 structure-skeleton refactor.)*

| Form | Geological reference | Current implementation | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **boulder** | glacial erratics, granitic exfoliation domes | `IcosahedronGeometry` + radial fBm/ridged displacement | **High** — the noise-driven path is faithful |
| **columnar** | [columnar jointing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columnar_jointing) in basalt (Giant's Causeway, Devils Tower) | hex-prism cylinders in hex close-pack, jittered | **Medium** — looks right, but the jointing *topology* (the fracture network) is hand-placed, not grown. The physics is in [Goehring, Morris & Lin 2006](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevE.74.036115) [8] / [Goehring 2009](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/0904.4055) [9]: columnar joints emerge from a desiccation/cooling front where drying and cracking timescales separate. A faithful model would simulate the cracking front, not place prisms. |
| **slate** | [foliation](https://www.files.ethz.ch/structuralgeology/jpb/files/english/9foliation.pdf) in low-grade metamorphic rock (slate→phyllite→schist→gneiss, [PSGT9](https://psgt.earth.lsa.umich.edu/chapter/9/fabrics.html)) | stacked `BoxGeometry` slabs offset in Y/XZ | **Medium** — reads as strata, but foliation is a *tectonic fabric* (aligned platy minerals), not just layering. |
| **crystal** | [radiating crystal clusters](https://opengeology.org/Mineralogy/14-mineral-descriptions/) — quartz geodes, acicular aragonite, prismatic goethite ([Mindat](https://www.mindat.org/gl/16896)) | central `ConeGeometry` + 5–9 satellite cones tilted outward | **Medium** — captures the silhouette. Real crystal habits follow from the mineral's lattice + nucleation density; [Worley 1996](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/237170.237267) [10] cellular noise is the natural CG fit for seeding nucleation points and is a candidate for Phase 5. |

### 5. Why not marching cubes / SDF / voxel?

For comparison, the alternatives we explicitly rejected:

- **Marching Cubes** ([Lorensen & Cline 1987](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jacobson/seminar/lorenson-and-cline-1987.pdf) [11]):
  extracting an iso-surface from a dense scalar field gives beautiful organic
  shapes, but for a *rock* it over-tessellates (you pay for volume resolution you
  don't see) and the erosion passes become field operations rather than the
  intuitive vertex-domain simulation we have. Better for caves than rocks.
- **Signed distance fields**: same trade-off, plus the boolean operations (carve,
  chip) are natural but the runtime cost in a WebGPU browser context is steep for
  a single-rock preview.
- **Pure height-field**: can't represent overhangs, and a boulder is a closed 3D
  solid, not a terrain.

The chosen "primitive + noise + vertex erosion" path keeps the mesh count
controllable (LOD-friendly), runs the erosion as direct mesh operations (easy to
reason about), and stays WebGPU-first without volume textures. *(Engineering
judgment, medium confidence.)*

### 6. Materials — triplanar, no UVs

There are **no UV coordinates** on SeedRock meshes. All textures (albedo, normal,
roughness, AO, moss/snow overlays) are sampled via **triplanar projection** from
`three/tsl` — three orthogonal planar samples blended by the dominant axis of the
world-space normal. This is the standard approach for rocks/terrain where you
cannot author UVs by hand and where seams are unacceptable; it trades a bit of
shader cost for seamless, scale-independent texturing on any closed surface.

AO is wired in as a custom TSL `aoNode` rather than a fixed material slot, and
moss/snow overlays are blended by **slope masks** computed from
`normalWorld.dot(up)` via `smoothstep` — moss on moderate slopes, snow on flatter
surfaces. This is a *phenomenological* model (moss grows where light and moisture
allow, snow sticks where slope permits), not a biological one.

### 7. Determinism — the `(species, seed)` contract

Every visible feature of a rock is a deterministic function of its `(species,
seed)` pair. The pattern, inherited from SeedThree's `rng.js`, is:

1. String seed `${preset.id}:${seed}` → `xmur3` hash → `splitmix32`-seeded
   counter (`src/core/rng.js`).
2. **One** `Rng` instance is threaded through generation in a fixed traversal
   order, and seeds the noise permutation table (`makeNoise3D(rng.int(...))`).
3. Adding features later must not shift existing output — the RNG draw order is
   part of the contract.

This is what makes the live viewer's deep-link URLs shareable, what makes the
Headless API round-trippable, and what lets the test suite assert seed
determinism.

## PART B — Mapping to the code

Read these files in this order to understand the pipeline end-to-end.

### B.1 Entry point — `src/generator/mesh.js`

`generateRockGeometry(preset, seed, opts)` ([mesh.js:27](../src/generator/mesh.js)):

1. Seed `Rng` from `${preset.id}:${seed}`.
2. Seed the noise table from `rng.int(1, 1_000_000)`.
3. **Dispatch by `preset.shape.form`** to one of four form factories
   ([mesh.js:36–49](../src/generator/mesh.js)). `STRUCTURAL_FORMS` (columnar /
   slate / crystal) skip the primary radial displacer — their character comes
   from the base geometry. Only `boulder` runs `displaceRadial()` as its primary
   shape driver.
4. `computeVertexNormals()`.
5. `applyErosion(geo, erosion, rng)` — mutates positions in place.
6. For `lowpoly` style: delete the `normal` attribute so flat-shading derives
   per-face normals ([mesh.js:54–59](../src/generator/mesh.js)).

The `STRUCTURAL_FORMS` guard at [mesh.js:18](../src/generator/mesh.js) is the
single most important architectural comment in the repo — it explains why boulder
is *special*. Phase 5 is essentially about making that asymmetry go away.

### B.2 Noise — `src/core/noise.js`

80 lines. `makeNoise3D(seed)` returns `{ noise, fbm, ridged }`:
- `noise(x,y,z)` — gradient noise, 12-gradient table (`GRAD3`, [noise.js:4](../src/core/noise.js)),
  quintic `fade` ([noise.js:10](../src/core/noise.js)), seeded Fisher–Yates
  permutation ([noise.js:22–27](../src/core/noise.js)).
- `fbm(x,y,z, octaves, lacunarity, gain)` — normalized fractal sum
  ([noise.js:54](../src/core/noise.js)).
- `ridged(x,y,z, octaves, lacunarity, gain)` — `(1−|n|)²` ridged multifractal
  ([noise.js:65](../src/core/noise.js)).

### B.3 Erosion — `src/generator/erosion.js`

`applyErosion(geo, erosionParams, rng)` ([erosion.js:197](../src/generator/erosion.js)):

1. Weld vertices (`mergeVertices`) so adjacency is meaningful.
2. `buildAdjacency()` ([erosion.js:14](../src/generator/erosion.js)) — per-vertex
   neighbor lists from the triangle index.
3. Run, in order, gated by `enabled !== false`:
   - `thermalErode` ([erosion.js:49](../src/generator/erosion.js)) — talus-angle
     diffusion, **Y-axis only** (see honest limitation in §3.1).
   - `hydraulicErode` ([erosion.js:86](../src/generator/erosion.js)) — droplet
     particle sim with inertia & evaporation.
   - `edgeWear` ([erosion.js:163](../src/generator/erosion.js)) — curvature-driven
     inward push along the radial normal.
4. Recompute normals.

### B.4 Forms — `src/generator/forms/`

- **boulder.js** — `IcosahedronGeometry(radius, detail)` welded, then
  `displaceRadial()` ([boulder.js:42](../src/generator/forms/boulder.js)) perturbs
  each vertex along its radial direction from `origin` by `noise.fbm` (or
  `ridged`), plus a high-frequency micro-displacement layer, then applies
  per-axis stretch/squash. *This is where SeedRock's silhouette actually comes
  from for most species.*
- **columnar.js** — hex close-pack (centre + ring + outer ring) of 6-sided
  `CylinderGeometry` columns, each with jittered height/tilt/radius, merged
  ([columnar.js:25](../src/generator/forms/columnar.js)).
- **slate.js** — 3–5 stacked `BoxGeometry` slabs in Y with XY offset and
  per-layer shrink ([slate.js:18](../src/generator/forms/slate.js)).
- **crystal.js** — central tall `ConeGeometry` + 5–9 satellite cones tilted
  outward via `setFromUnitVectors` ([crystal.js:23](../src/generator/forms/crystal.js)).

### B.5 Species — `src/species/`

Species are **data-only preset objects** — no logic, validated at load time by
`validate.js`. Each carries `{ id, name, latin, biome, color, roughness,
metalness, textures, shape: { form, radius, detail, ... }, noise: { scale, octaves,
... }, erosion: { thermal, hydraulic, edgeWear }, lod: {...} }`. Logic lives in
`generator/` and `materials/`. See `_template.js` for the schema and
[`COMMUNITY_SPECIES.md`](COMMUNITY_SPECIES.md) for the contribution recipe.

### B.6 Materials — `src/materials/rock-material.js`

`makeRockMaterial(preset, maps, overlay, overlayMaps, { style })` branches on
style: PBR (`MeshStandardNodeMaterial`, or `MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial` with
`transmission` for ice), Toon (`MeshToonNodeMaterial` + 4-band DataTexture ramp),
Low Poly (standard + `flatShading`). All textures sampled via TSL `triplanarTexture()`;
moss/snow blended by slope masks from `normalWorld.dot(up)`.

### B.7 Export — `src/export/glb.js`

`GLTFExporter` binary. Emits the `MSFT_lod` extension (groups `*_LOD0/1/2/3`
nodes, attaches screen-coverage hints) and an auto-generated `*_collider` proxy
mesh (reduced-LOD geometry, position-only, `visible:false`) for engine physics
import.

## Future: structure skeleton

The clearest gap vs. SeedThree's architecture is the **absence of a
topology-first intermediate representation**. SeedThree generates `stems[]`
(points/radii/orients/winds — pure structure) and *then* meshes them, so LOD,
wind, and export all reuse one skeleton. SeedRock goes straight primitive →
geometry, so each form has its own ad-hoc mesher and there is no shared "structure
graph" the mesher consumes.

Phase 5 (design doc only, not yet implemented) proposes a `StructureGraph` schema
— joint sets for columnar, foliation planes for slate, nucleation points for
crystal, displacement nodes for boulder — produced before meshing. The geological
references for each are: columnar jointing physics [8][9], foliation fabrics
([ETH Zurich structural geology notes](https://www.files.ethz.ch/structuralgeology/jpb/files/english/9foliation.pdf)
[12]; [PSGT9](https://psgt.earth.lsa.umich.edu/chapter/9/fabrics.html) [13]),
crystal habit ([OpenGeology Mineralogy](https://opengeology.org/Mineralogy/14-mineral-descriptions/) [14]),
and — aspirational, for `river_cobble` — Domokos–Gibbons pebble abrasion
([Domokos & Gibbons 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3922984/) [15]).
